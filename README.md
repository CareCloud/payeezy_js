1. Payeezy.js (which is included on the page using a &lt; script> tag) intercepts the form submit, and then
asynchronously posts the credit card details to Payeezy. This call uses JSONP over https, passing in API key and an
identifier– trtoken. Both of these values are provisioned for the merchant‘s developer via the developer portal.
2. On success Payeezy returns a token (type=FDtoken) to payeezy.js. Failure messages are returned in the response,
which can be handled as appropriate.
3. Payeezy.js then submits the form with the primary and secondary transactions as shown in the diagram above.
